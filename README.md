# euler-45-challenge
A small bench-marking challenge for Euler-45 problem

This repository has been created as part of a small Euler-45 challenge.

Euler-45 problem:
Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:<br>
Triangle	 	Tn=n(n+1)/2	 	1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...<br>
Pentagonal	 	Pn=n(3n−1)/2	 	1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
Hexagonal	 	Hn=n(2n−1)	 	1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...


The challenge is to benchmark a specific algorithm for finding all Euler triplets between 0 and 10M (or any other upper boundary), and printing them to stdout.
The goal of the challenge is NOT finding the best algorithm, and thus a very strict algorithm was chosen.
The goal is to compare programming and optimization capabilities and comparing performance of different programming languages.
The chosen algorithm is an O(n) algorithm.
It is not the best there is (because we want to benchmark some hard and varied calculations).
It is also not the worst one (we still want it to end sometime).

Description of the algorithm:
1. For each i between 0 and 10M: add [Triangle(i) -> i] entry into triangles_map
2. For each j between 0 and 10M:
     if(Pentagonal(j) belongs to triangles_map):
       add [Pentagonal(j) -> j] entry into pentagonals_map
3. For each k between 0 and 10M:
    if(Hexagonal(k) belongs to pentagonals_map):
      let val = Hexagonal(k)
      remember the tuplet: <triangles_map[val], pentagonals_map[val], k, val>
4. Print all tuplets to stdout.

Rules for participaitng in the challenge:
1. If you want to participate, send me your username and I will give you push privileges.
2. Open a directory under the root one and all your code and binaries into it.
3. You may implement the algorithm in your favorite language.
4. You may supply your own runtime and compilation environments: Java implementors may supply JRE, a script for running the program with any flag she desires, etc. C/C++ implementor may supply makefile, gcc, etc.
5. You may and welcome parlelize yout programm.
6. You may use any external library you want (exceot of course one that directly solves the problem).
7. The first line in main method must print the current system time.
8. When all calculations are finished, and all results are printed to stdout, you need to print the current system time.
9. Comparison will be based on the mentioned timestamps.
10. Ne other prints are required.
11. Each should present a program (or script running the program) that accepts two argument: First one is the max number to check, and the other is max number of threads.
12. To keep fairness, anyone may run each other's code and create his own benchmark.
